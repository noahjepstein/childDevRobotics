This repository tracks software written for a RapberryPi powered children's game.

The game tracks RFID-tagged play food items so that children combine them to
make healthy meals. The game uses a USB-serial RFID reader with a Rasberry Pi
to track foods, then stores information about the foods that are currently in play.
